This repository demonstrates a common error in C programming: incorrectly using the `free()` function. The `bug.c` file contains code that attempts to free memory that was not dynamically allocated. This leads to undefined behavior, potentially causing crashes or unpredictable results. The `bugSolution.c` file provides a corrected version of the code.
